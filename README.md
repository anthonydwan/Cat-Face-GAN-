# Cat-Face-GAN-

I will be using basic GAN model to create cat face images. I hope to learn new methods along the way and come back to this project to pregressively improve my results!

Enjoy!

## Comments and Conclusions

Currently, you may see that there are some resemblance of cat faces in the images but they are not satisfactory results:
1. there are few images that look like smears; 
2. some indication of model collapse:
  1. the best results are quite similar;
  2. all results are of black or ginger coloured cats.

## Next Steps 

My next step is to learn about cycleGAN (and other more advanced techniques) and revisit this model.

# Cat-Face-GAN-

I will be using basic GAN model to create cat face images. I hope to learn new methods along the way and come back to this project to pregressively improve my results!

Enjoy!

Currently, you may see that there are some resemblance of cat faces in the images but they are not completely satisfactory results. My next step is to learn about cycleGAN (and other more advanced techniques) and revisit this model.
